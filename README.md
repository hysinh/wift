## Introduction
The Guild of Women in Film & Television - Ireland, or WIFT, website is a full-stack, e-commerce-based, web application created with HTML, CSS, JS, Python, the Django web framework and the Bootstrap library. This website application allows user to view the programs and events available to the creater WIFT community and encourages women in the industry to join the organisation for access to it's networking opportunities and access to educational and mentoring opportunities. Visitors to the website are able to view events, programs, and membership opportunities on the website. If the user chooses to join, they can select a membership level, register as a site user, and purchase this membership online. This purchase and registration allows the user to access a member dashboard that allows them to manage their personal details, their public profile published in a member directory, and to view that member directory as well as past membership purchases.

## User Experience
The goal of the WIFT website is to provide a business and membership management tool that allows this organisation to engage meaningfully with it's members and the greater film and television industry and supporters. The website offers information about WIFT events, programs, as well as membership opportunities that the visitor can purchase for additional access to the WIFT community and membership directory. Once the user registers on the website and purchases a membership, they can access and manage their personal information, create/view/edit/delete their public profile that is published in a membership directory only accessible to members.

I chose this very specific idea because I was approached by a similar Irish organisation to redesign their website. Although I declined to put in a proposal, I thought it was a good opportunity to apply the knowledge that I have gained from this course to solving some of the membership and access needs of an organisation like this. 

- ### Project Goals
  - Create a shopping cart system that allows clients to register for the site and purchase a membership with the WIFT organisation.
  - Create a website that offers information about on-going and up-coming events and programs relevant to women in the film and television industry.
  - Create a dashboard that member to manage their personal data and public profile (create/edit/delete) as well as view all their past membership purchases in a manageable way.
  - Create an admin portal where staff could manage the membership data of all the members, view membership purchases, and messages via the contact form.
  - Create a website that was responsive and attractive

- ### Visitor Goals
  As a user, I want to easily view upcoming events and programs as well membership options at WIFT and be able to purchase a membership as well as manage my personal information once I am a member.

- ### User Stories
  1. As a Site User, I cam view information about the organisation.
  2. As a Site User, I can view membership levels and benefits and find out how to sign up with WIFT.
  3. As a Site User, I want to view information on public programs and events so that I can attend or participate in WIFT events and programs.
  4. As a Potential Registered User, I can register for an account so that I can access begin the first step of membership.
  5. As a Registered User, I can easily log in or out or recover my password.
  6. As a Registered user, I receive an email confirmation after registering to verify that my account registration was successful.
  7. As a Registered User, I can purchase a specific membership based on my membership needs and professional level.
  8. As a Registered User, I can easily select a membership, view the selected membership in a shopping basket, and easily checkout.
  9. As a Registered user, I will see a confirmation that my purchase was successful and verify that I purchased the correct membership.
  10. As a Registered user, I will receieve an email confirmation after my purchase is complete and can keep this information for my records.
  11. As a visitor, I can see customized error pages for 404 and 500 errors so that I can understand what happened and take the appropriate action.

  ### Site Admin Stories
  1. As a site admin, I can create and manage personal information for the members of the WIFT organisation.
  2. As a site admin, I add/update/delete membership options so that the most updated membership options are available for the site users to purchase.
  3. As a Super User or Admin, I can access the admin panel/dashboard so that I can edit member information and make/edit/review/update/delete member data.
  4. As a Site admin, I can view messages sent to the organisaiton via the website contact form.


## Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was the project management approach used for this project. I attempted to break the project into phases and followed a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating. I struggled with how to organise this properly on our Portfolio Project #4. So, I hope I was more successful with my final project.

All issues/user stories began in the Backlog section. As I got to a section, I moved issues from the backlog into the "Ready" section and as I began work on that specific issue, I moved it into the "In progress" section. As issues were resolved, they were moved into the "Done" column.

I also implemented the MoSCoW prioritisation scheme (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have). 

- ### Kanban Board 
  I used the GitHub Project board to design and manage a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/hysinh/projects/6)

### UI Design
  I began my design phase with creating a flow chart, then designing the Entity Relationship Diagram for the database tables. After creating the flow of the website, I drew wireframes for the majority of the pages. Then I designed the user interface in Adobe Photoshop to set the style for the website.

  #### Font Family
  For the body and majority of the website, Poppins was used for it's readability and versatility. For the main headers, I used Bebas Neue in upper caps. For the WIFT logo/brand, I used a font called US 101. I wanted an clean, strong, serif typeface that gave the brand the weight and modern look I wanted to convey for a contemporary but serious feeling.
  <details >
  <summary>Fonts</summary>

  </details>

  #### Responsiveness
  The WIFT website needed to be responsive and available on a variety of screen sizes and devices to make it as accessible as possible. Although I made some small adjustments for sizes outside the ones listed below, I mainly focused on the following sizes:

  1. Mobile Device dimensions (larger): 375px and larger
  2. Tablet Device dimensions: 768px and larger
  3. Laptop Device dimensions: 992px and larger

### Database Design
Custom models were created for Membership Purchases, Member Private Data, Member Public Data, Membership Categories, and Messages (sent via the contact form).
