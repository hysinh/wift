## Testing
### Validator Testing
This application was developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python using the Django Web Framework.

  ### Search Engine Optimization, Accessibility, Best Practices, & Performance
  - #### Google Lighthouse Audits
    Google Lighthouse was used to assess each page on it's performance, accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. Using google fonts, font awesome as well as an Google maps embed all affected the performance of different pages as they are considered render-blocking resources. For my mobile performance assessments, the ratings were a little low due to the featured image file size. Although I used a smaller image set to 800px x 450px which affected the ratings only a little, the file size was still a bit larger than the Lighthouse standard. I decided that I didn't want to compromise the image size or quality further as it is an integral part of the website branding.

  ### Unresolved Linter Code Errors
  | Bug | Line | Unresolved Reason |
  | --- | ---- | --- |
  | The placeholder set on select option for the country field for the form caused an error. | edit_private_data.html - line 197 | I attempted to remove the blank label from the country field in the Member Private Data model but it did not resolve the issue. I think that it is something that is part of django countryfield module that I could not resolve. |
  | The placeholder set on select option for the country field for the form caused an error. | checkout/checkout.html - line 95, checkout/checkout_existing_member.html - line 92 | This was bug was not resolved. Please see line above for reason. |
  | h1 tag with no content | checkout/checkout.html - line 131, checkout/checkout_existing_member.html - line 128 | The h1 tag is used to hold the loading spinner. This was loading spinner solution was derived from the Boutique Ado project, I chose to leave the code as it was and will resolve this in a future version.
  | There were a few places that were greater than the 79 character length max | settings.py - line 129 | Was unable to resolve as caused more errors when shortened |
  | There were a few places that were greater than the 79 character length max | views.py | Could not reduce error strings further and was unable to break up the line without causing further problems |
  | HTML errors | account/signup.html | These html errors were inside the built in Django signup form |
